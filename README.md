## Description 

This course develops the theoretical basis as well as practical algorithms for automatically extracting useful information about the world by carrying out computations on images or image sequences. First, a number of basic image processing concepts are briefly reviewed, such as digitization, preprocessing, image restoration and segmentation. Standard linear image processing algorithms are discussed as well as some concepts and algorithms from nonlinear morphological image processing. Also, some recent results on multiscale image analysis are presented. Then we move to higher level operations, such as object recognition, pattern recognition and three-dimensional scene analysis. Making inferences of a 3D world from 2D pictures requires the analysis of projection methods, geometric transformations and illumination models. We study the shape recovery problem, that is, the question of how object properties such as shape can be reconstructed from features which can be measured in images. As an illustration of the theory we discuss shape from texture, shape from shading, shape from stereo and shape from motion. Practical Information: Lab assignments using an image processing package. As an alternative to the regular practicals, students can elect to do a short research project.
